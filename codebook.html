            <p>For the multi-year ACS/PRCS samples, YEAR indicates the last year of data included (e.g., 2007 for the 2005-2007 3-year ACS/PRCS; 2008 for the 2006-2008 3-year ACS/PRCS; and so on).  For the actual year of survey in these multi-year data, see MULTYEAR.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>SAMPLE identifies the IPUMS sample from which the case is drawn. Each sample receives a unique 6-digit code. The codes are structured as follows:</p>
            <p>The first four digits are the year of the census/survey.</p>
            <p>The next two digits identify the sample within the year.
For most censuses, IPUMS has multiple datasets which were constructed using different sampling techniques (i.e. size/demographic of the sample population, geographic coverage level or location, or duration of the sampling period for the ACS/PRCS samples).  </p>
            <p>The availability table for each variable indicates whether that variable is available in only certain samples for a given year. For further discussion of sample differences, see "Sample Designs.".</p>
            <p>Note: SAMPLE replaces DATANUM. Though the last two digits in SAMPLE do not correlate exactly with the now-deprecated DATANUM, the variable serves the same purpose of assigning a unique id to all cases that belong to the same dataset.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>HHWT indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample. </p>
            <p>It is generally a good idea to use HHWT when conducting a household-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of HHWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. HHWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for household-level analyses of any sample other than those.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>STATEICP identifies the state in which the housing unit was located, using the coding scheme developed by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). The ICPSR scheme orders states first by geographic division and then alphabetically within each division. Note that the ICPSR geographic divisions do not correspond exactly with the census regions used in the IPUMS variable REGION. </p>
            <p>State or territory names represent that state or territory's contemporary political boundaries for a given year. Users should familiarize themselves with any historical changes in these boundaries that might affect their research. (Go here for year-by-year maps of states and territories in the U.S.) IPUMS assigns current state codes to territories that later became states; for example, Arizona Territory in 1880 and 1900 is given the Arizona state code (61). In 1880, Dakota Territory counties are split between areas that ultimately became North and South Dakota.</p>

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.</p>
            <p>Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.</p>

            <p>It is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of PERWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. PERWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for person-level analyses of any sample other than those.</p>
            <p>For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" and "Sample Weights". See also HHWT for a corresponding variable at the household level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 and 1950.</p>

            <p>INCTOT reports each respondent's total pre-tax personal income or losses from all sources for the previous year. The censuses collected information on income received from these sources during the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, the reference period was the past 12 months. Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation:</p>
            <p>Users studying change over time must adjust for inflation. Consumer Price Index adjustment factors for the appropriate years can be found in the CPI99 variable.</p>
            <p>The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.</p>
            <p>User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note for further details.</p>
            <p>For a more complete discussion of the use of these factors to adjust for inflation, users may wish to see the IPUMS-CPS note on adjusting dollar amount variables for inflation.</p>

            <p>INCWAGE reports each respondent's total pre-tax wage and salary income - that is, money received as an employee - for the previous year. The censuses collected information on income received from these sources during the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, the reference period was the past 12 months. Sources of income in INCWAGE include wages, salaries, commissions, cash bonuses, tips, and other money income received from an employer. Payments-in-kind or reimbursements for business expenses are not included. See the comparability discussion below for further information.</p>
            <p>Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation (See INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors). The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.</p>
            <p>User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note for further details.</p>

            <p>INCEARN reports income earned from wages or a person's own business or farm for the previous year. The censuses collected information on income received from these sources during the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, the reference period was the past 12 months. The value of INCEARN is the total for the IPUMS variables INCWAGE, INCBUS, and INCFARM (for 1990) and for INCWAGE and INCBUS00 (for the 2000 census, the ACS, and the PRCS). Note that these components of INCEARN are themselves already Top coded. See those variables for further discussion.  Because the universe for those variables is age 16+, all persons under age 16 have a value of 0 for INCEARN.</p>
            <p>Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation (See INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors).

            <h3>Variable Description</h3>
            <p>POVERTY reports the total annual income of each person's family expressed as a percentage of their family's poverty threshold. POVERTY assigns all members of each family-not each household-the same value. Families are identified by the variable FAMUNIT, which is based on the IPUMS-created family interrelationship variables. POVERTY is calculated by comparing the value of FTOTINC to the family's poverty threshold, which is determined by the family's size, number of children, and age of the householder. See the poverty definition page for more information on poverty thresholds. POVERTY is also calculated for unrelated individuals over age 15 living in households, while group quarters residents are excluded. </p>
            <p>In all samples, POVERTY is calculated by IPUMS based on income, family composition, and the associated poverty threshold within each family unit (as defined by FAMUNIT). The original census microdata samples from 1990 onward and the ACS/PRCS included a version of poverty calculated by the Census Bureau, but due to the different family definitions used by the Census Bureau, this original variable does not always match POVERTY. The original Census Bureau poverty values can be found in the variable CBPOVERTY. Note that while the original variables in the 2006 and later ACS/PRCS samples (reported in CBPOVERTY) included values for some group quarters residents, these are all treated as not-in-universe for POVERTY.</p>
            <p>Note that IPUMS applies the income adjustment factor before calculating poverty in the ACS and PRCS, although use of this adjustment is not recommended by IPUMS generally (see the ACS income standardization note for more information.)</p>
